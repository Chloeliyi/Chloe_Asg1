Assignment 1

My assignment 1 website is a website about a Kpop band named NCT.

# Design Process

This website was made in mind for new fans of the band to learn more about the group through providing information about the members, what music they have, where to purchase their merchandise and other resources such as social media accounts.

User Stories: <br>
.As a new fan, I want to find out more information about the band members so that I can learn more about them.
